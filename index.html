                <h2>History</h2>
                <P>by Bob Vitrikas


                    The MG slogan ‘Safety Fast!’ has been associated with the MG marque for 94 years and the MG Car Club
                    for 64 years. Where did the idea come from?

                    In fact this story comes to us courtesy of Pat Ewing, my South African MG friend Norm Ewing’s wife.
                    In 1975 Norm and Pat were visiting George and Susan Tuck, MG Publicity Manager who settled in South
                    Africa during his retirement.

                    Pat asked George that same question, “Where did ‘Safety Fast!’ come from?” George replied, “That’s
                    an interesting story.” And so it was! In Norm’s words, here’s how George told the story....


                    “He told us how one rainy day in 1929, his boss Ted Colegrove was driving behind one of the new
                    Oxford busses. To warn those behind that it was fitted with brakes all round, and not just at the
                    front so it could stop much quicker, painted on the back was a large Dewandre Triangle with ‘Safety
                    First!’ emblazoned on it.</P>
