# MG PROJECT

An imaginary website for my car brand that made with Html,Css,Javascript that talk about the MG (Morris Garages) cars, highlighting their innovation and design evolution. It features notable models like the electric Cyberster, MG E-motion Concept, and the MG6 sedan, emphasizing performance, comfort, and a blend of classic British and modern aesthetics. The page also includes the brand's slogan history, “Safety Fast!”, and provides contact details for further engagement
